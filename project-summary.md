# Project Summary

Here's the thing: most websites show the exact same homepage to every single visitor. Someone ready to buy right now sees the same page as someone just browsing, comparing options, or shopping for a gift. The page never adapts, and the visitor leaves. Big companies fix this with expensive personalization tools that cost six figures a year. Small businesses on Shopify, Webflow, or WordPress? They're on their own.

We built Tailored, a drop-in AI widget that personalizes any website with a single script tag. Paste one line of code, and it starts working. No backend, no configuration, no waiting months for setup. It reads signals that are already there, what the visitor searched, where they came from, what device they're on, what time of day it is, and picks the best hero section from a set of 6 intent-driven templates.

The part we're most proud of is the speed. Our two-phase approach shows a personalized hero instantly using a rules engine, then quietly upgrades it with Gemini AI in the background. Visitors never see a loading state. If the AI hiccups, the rules-based version stays up, nothing breaks.

Right now, the working demo includes the full embeddable widget, all 6 hero variants powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, a live analytics dashboard tracking every decision, and a preview panel where you can click through each intent and watch the page transform in real time. Every decision comes with a plain-English explanation of why the AI made that choice, no black box.

It's personalization that actually works out of the box, for the sites that need it most.
